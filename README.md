Create an Alexa skill in python that uses Alexa Presentation Language (APL) to display on an Alexa screen
=========================================

This tutorial walks through creating an Alexa skill in Python using the ASK - CLI. 

It assumes you have some familiarity with Python (or a similar programming language) and the Alexa Skills Kit.
Even if you're using an Alexa Hosted skill or AWS Lambda skill, the Python parts are the same.

Please note that this is the first github I've posted, so bear with me if there are problems!

Concepts
--------

This is a simple example so that you can understand the basics of APL, modifying the python code to add a directive and testing the code in the developer or on a device.
The actual APL only shows some text on the screen but having got that far, they are plenty of examples of more complicated APL that you can look at!

It closely follows the NodeJS blog by Stuart Pocklington, which I urge you to read:

Setup
-----

To run this example skill you will need to setup ASK CLI and choose an editing environment (I use Visual Studio) 

The text version of this is in the instruction section but the full word document, including screenshots is available at:

I apologise if that's not in the scheme of github
